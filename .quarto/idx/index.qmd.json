Innovating subsequent courses is also important, so students can continue developing these skills beyond the first course. In this session, we'll present a modern approach to teaching undergraduate regression analysis, the second statistics course for many students. We'll share strategies for using real-world data sets and examples, teaching modern computing skills, and incorporating non-technical skills such as writing and effective collaboration as part of the course. We'll share example activities and assignments, along with a demo of the computing toolkit using the R tidymodels package, Quarto for reproducible reports, and Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. The activities and demo will be hands-on; attendees will also have the opportunity to exchange ideas and ask questions throughout the session.\n\n# Presenters\n\n![](images/maria.png){style=\"float:right;padding: 0 0 0 10px;\" fig-alt=\"Headshot of Dr. Maria Tackett\" width=\"200\"}\n\n[**Dr. Maria Tackett**](https://mariatackett.net) is an Assistant Professor of the Practice in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University. Her current work focuses on understanding how active learning strategies can be used to promote engagement and student motivation in undergraduate statistics courses. She also studies how classroom practices in introductory math and statistics courses impact students' sense of community, self-efficacy, and learning outcomes. Maria is an RStudio certified trainer and is actively involved in the R and statistics education communities.\n\n<br>\n\n![](images/mine.png){style=\"float:right;padding: 0 0 0 10px;\" fig-alt=\"Headshot of Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel\" width=\"200\"}\n\n[**Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel**](http://mine-cr.com/) (she/her) is Professor of the Practice and Director of Undergraduate Studies at the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University.
